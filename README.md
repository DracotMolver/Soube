# Soube

Soube is a simple and minimalist music player based on Electronjs. Therefor, you can install it in **Linux**, **Windows** and **Mac**.
With Soube, you can play the next music files: MP3, WMV, WAV and OGG. Also, you can change the color of the app (Pink, Orange, Blue, Purple, Black and Grey).

The idea behind Soube is a simple music player but powerful enough, having features like an equalizer panel. So, your music will real sounds good.

> **Important!:** Soube doesn't and won't play music from stream services like Spotify or Google Play Music.

> **Warning!:** When you are loading your songs and it gets to **100%** and takes too long. Please, be patient and don't close the app. *(There are many aliens working behind)*

> **Note:** Soube will only play music from local files. But!, I'm working of reading music from a media device (Pendrive, CD  - yes!, CD, and Smartphone) and from a networking.

> **Linux** New versions are only aviable for `rpm` and `deb` extensions
